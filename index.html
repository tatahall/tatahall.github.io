            <p class="text">Adapt. Improvise. Overcome.</p>
            <p class="text">I want to be a doctor when I grow up.  That’s what I told everyone around me from the sixth grade until graduate school.  Two years of graduate school later and I finally admitted the truth – I didn’t want to be a doctor anymore.  The problem was that I didn’t know what I wanted to be or where I wanted to go.</p>
            <p class="text">My overarching goal was this:  no matter where I went or what I did, I wanted to be challenged; I wanted to be constantly learning new skills; I wanted to be in a position of being able to share what I had learned; I wanted to help people – even if it was a tangential effect.</p>
            <p class="text">With this goal, I could only go into one industry – health insurance.  This wasn’t what I dreamed of when I came up with my goal; but, like every other responsible adult, I needed money, and the company that hired me was willing to pay me money. However, I’ve learned to make the most of where I am and be grateful.</p>
            <p class="text">And thank goodness…because it turned out, I was good at health insurance.  Every position I held progressively increased my accountabilities and responsibilities; and allowed me to add to my skillset arsenal.</p>
